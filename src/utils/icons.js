/**
 * SVG icons for use in the Cylc UI:
 * - Centralise icons for use throughout multiple components.
 * - Define custom icons.
 * - Reformat icons for other source.
 *
 * Note, the `<v-icon>` component expects icons in the MDI format i.e.:
 * - A string representing an SVG path.
 * - Consisting of a bezier curve (e.g. `M 0,0 C 1,1 Z`).
 * - That fits within a 24px box.
