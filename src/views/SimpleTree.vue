  This is a bare-bones text-based tree view that displays live workflow data.

  It is intended to serve as a basis for future live-view development and to
  serve as functional documentation for view writing.

  NOTE:
    This view is not available in "production" mode.

      <li>
        <b>{{ node.id }}</b>
        <!-- Then iterate over the children of those nodes.

          NOTE:
            "node.children" is always present on a node so you shouldn't have to
            do "node.children || []" here.
          NOTE:
            "node.id" is a good choice for the ":key" as every node in the store
            has a unique ID.

                The data store promises to make this information available but
                doesn't make any promises about when it will make this available.
                Just because a node exists in the store doesn't mean it will have
                all of the data you requested, yet. Code defensibly in
                anticipation of "undefined" keys.

                don't know how deep the tree is going to be, however, to keep
                this simple we will just hardcode it.
