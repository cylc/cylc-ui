# Cylc UI: How to Contribute

## Report Bugs

Report bugs by opening an issue [on
Github](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues). Give the version
affected by the bug (you should test the latest release if possible) and a
recipe to reproduce the problem.

## Request Enhancements

Request enhancements by opening an issue at [Github
](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues). Describe your use case in
detail.

## Contribute Code

All contributions to project are made via Pull Requests against the *master*
branch of [cylc/cylc-ui](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui).
Non-trivial developments must be discussed and agreed in advance in a
[Issue](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues) as the team may not
be able to consider large changes that appear out of the blue. New
contributors should add their details to the [Code Contributors
](#code-contributors) section of this file as part of their first Pull
Request, and reviewers are responsible for checking this before merging the
new branch into *master*.
